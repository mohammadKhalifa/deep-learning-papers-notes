## Paper Summary

* The main idea on which the paper is based is that the architecture and connectivity of neural networks can be described with a variable-length string. Thus it's possible to use an RNN to generate such string.

* At each step, the RNN produces the filter height, filter width, stride height, stride width and number of filters corresponding to successive layer. See the figure.
