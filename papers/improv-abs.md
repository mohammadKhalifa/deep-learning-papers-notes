## Improving Abstraction in Text Summarization 

#### Key Points :
* Summarization is the processing of compressing a long sequence of text into a more compact form.
* The paper builds on the deep reinforced model proposed by (Paulus et. al, 2017).
* Their main contribution is a two-fold :
    * Introducing a language model into the decoding process to improve readability and conciseness.
    * Introducing a new reward whose aim is to encourage the generation of novel n-grams that are not present in the source document.
